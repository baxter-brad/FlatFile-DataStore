    'Hugh F. Aiken on left with portrait of Thomas Butler King at the launching of the Thomas Butler King Liberty ship from the J.A. Jones Construction Company shipyard in Brunswick, Georgia. On the right, the unidentified man might possibly be Nat M. Campbell, executive assistant, and later, a payroll superintendent for the J.A. Jones Construction Company. The edges of the photograph have yellowed. Named for Coastal Georgia planter and politician Thomas Butler King (1800-1864), the ship was the fiftieth constructed in Brunswick by the J.A. Jones Construction Company. Its keel was laid June 23, 1944. The ship was launched August 7, 1944 and delivered August 19, 1944.',
