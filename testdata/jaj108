    'Group of workers from the J.A. Jones Construction Company in Brunswick, Georgia being led in prayer by a minister before laying the keel of a Liberty ship. The minister, in striped shirt and tie, is accompanied by a worker who has removed his hard hat, presumably in prayer. Both men are holding onto a large bar that has been suspended by cable and rope from above. One worker has left his hard hat resting on a wooden support structure; another holds his hat under his arm; both hats are marked with text that is not legible.',
