    'Aerial view of the construction of the James B. Duke at the J.A. Jones Construction Company shipyard in Brunswick, Georgia taken from near the ship\'s stern. A crane is hoisted above the ship, though most of it is cropped out of view. The cable and hook are dangling from the top of the shot. Ladders and scaffolding have been built around the ship, and workers are visible on the top. Named for president of the American Tobacco Company and co-founder of the Southern Company James Buchanan Duke (1856-1925), the James B. Duke was the forty-third ship built by the J.A. Jones Construction Company in Brunswick, Georgia. Its keel was laid April 29, 1944. The ship was launched June 19, 1944 and delivered June 30, 1944.',
