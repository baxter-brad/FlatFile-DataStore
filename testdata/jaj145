    'A male and female worker, high on the mast, build the superstructure of a Liberty ship at the J.A. Jones Construction Company shipyard, Brunswick, Georgia. The man, wearing a hard hat, stands on top of a ladder welded to the mast, with tools in his back pocket; the young woman is strapped to a wooden swingseat that appears to be operated by a rope and pulley. Both workers are smiling at the camera.',
