    'Mrs. J. Melville Broughton, wife of Governor Joseph Melville Broughton of North Carolina, is poised with a bottle of champagne, ready to christen the Donald W. Bain at a ceremonial Liberty ship launching held in the J.A. Jones Construction Company shipyard in Brunswick, Georgia. An unidentified woman, clutching a purse, stands behind Mrs. Broughton. Named for former North Carolina treasurer Donald W. Bain (d. 1892), the ship was the forty-first constructed in Brunswick by the J.A. Jones Construction Company. Its keel was laid April 17, 1944. The ship was launched May 25, 1944 and delivered June 17, 1944.',
