    'Emil J. Kratt, general manager, and an unknown woman at a lectern (possibly Mr. Coffin\'s wife, Teddie) are both holding a photograph of Howard E. Coffin at the launching of the Howard E. Coffin Liberty ship on the premises of the shipyard of the J.A. Jones Construction Company in Brunswick, Georgia. Two men look on from the side. Named for automotive industrialist and Saint Simons Island and Sea Island developer Howard Earle Coffin (1873-1937), the ship was the twenty-fourth constructed in Brunswick by the J.A. Jones Construction Company. Its keel was laid November 30, 1943. The ship was launched January 21, 1944 and delivered January 31, 1944.',
