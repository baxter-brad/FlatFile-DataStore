    'A young child standing on a podium helps a man conduct a band during the launching of the Henry W. Grady from the J.A. Jones Construction Company shipyard in Brunswick, Georgia. Members of the band are wearing hard hats, as are some members of the audience, which includes shipyard workers and WACs. The writing visible on some of the hard hats is not legible. Named for Atlanta journalist, political leader, and New South booster Henry Woodfin Grady (1850-1889), the ship was the thirteenth constructed in Brunswick by the J.A. Jones Construction Company. Its keel was laid July 31, 1943. The ship was launched October 22, 1943 and delivered October 30, 1943. ',
