    'Assorted standards flown over the shipyard of the J.A. Jones Construction Company, Brunswick, Georgia. The U.S. flag flies highest. From  a separate pole beneath the U.S. flag flies what appears to be a USMC flag (a dark field with a lighter emblem); Beneath, on the same halyard, is a J.A. Jones Construction Company house flag, a dark field with the logo "Jones" in a lighter color. The "J" in "Jones" is made of a large anchor with the letter "J" set inside a circle above the fluke. One level down, from the cross-pole beneath, fly three pennants: on the right halyard is a pennant with a dark field and light-colored emblem (possibly a minuteman encircled by thirteen stars?), and what appears to be the number "7" in the lower right corner. On the opposite side are two more pennants: the first is a dark field with a light-colored emblem (illegible), and one more flag at the bottom of the same halyard, a dark field with a light-colored letter "M."',
