    'Photograph of the officers of the U.S.S. Hornet, sent as a token of thanks to the workers of the J.A. Jones Construction Company in Brunswick, Georgia, for working without pay on Christmas Day, 1944, as an act of support for Allied military personnel worldwide. In the photograph, nine officers stand in front of a kill chart that reads "Destination Tokyo," and includes strike information for several Pacific campaigns. Based on the height of the officers, the chart appears to be somewhere between ten and twelve feet high. Each destroyed Japanese ship and airplane is represented by a Japanese flag; larger flags seem to correspond with larger hits. ',
