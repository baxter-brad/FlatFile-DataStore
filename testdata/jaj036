    'Mona Douglas, Mrs. Alfred W. Jones (with champagne), and Dorothy Torras at the christening of the Howard E. Coffin at a ceremonial Liberty ship launching, held in the J.A. Jones Construction Company shipyard in Brunswick, Georgia. Attached to Mrs. Jones\' wrist (or perhaps the champagne bottle) is a ribbon sash, possibly printed with the ship\'s name. Named for automotive industrialist and Saint Simons Island and Sea Island developer Howard Earle Coffin (1873-1937), the ship was the twenty-fourth constructed in Brunswick by the J.A. Jones Construction Company. Its keel was laid November 30, 1943. The ship was launched January 21, 1944 and delivered January 31, 1944.',
