    'Large group of workers exiting through the gates of the shipyards of the J.A. Jones Construction Company in Brunswick, Georgia. Each gateway entrance and queue seems to be organized by job type; the only legible gate sign, on the right side of the photograph, reads "Welders." A large placard hung over the gates with an illustration of Uncle Sam reads: "Fellow Presentee: This Is Your War" [the smaller text beneath the heading is illegible]. ',
